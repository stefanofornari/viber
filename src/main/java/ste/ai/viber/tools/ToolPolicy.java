/**
 * Defines the execution policy for a tool method, allowing for fine-grained
 * control over how and when tools are executed.
 * <p>
 * <b>Rationale:</b>
 * Not all tools are created equal. Some tools are safe, read-only operations
 * (e.g., listing files), while others perform sensitive or destructive actions
 * (e.g., writing to a file, executing a shell command). This annotation
 * provides a mechanism to classify tools so that a "human in the middle" (HITM)
 * or a safety supervisor can decide whether to allow an execution.
 * <p>
 * The policies are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link Policy#READONLY}: For safe, read-only operations that do not
 *     change system state. These are typically allowed to run without
 *     interruption.</li>
 *     <li>{@link Policy#READWRITE}: For operations that modify files or system
 *     state. These are considered high-risk and should be intercepted for
 *     approval.</li>
 *     <li>{@link Policy#INTERACTIVE}: For tools that inherently require user
 *     interaction (e.g., opening an editor). These are allowed to run without
 *     pre-approval, as the interaction itself is the approval.</li>
 *     <li>{@link Policy#UNKNOWN}: The default policy for any tool where the
 *     risk level is not specified. To err on the side of caution, these are
 *     treated as high-risk and are intercepted for approval.</li>
 * </ul>
 * If this annotation is not present on a {@code @Tool} method, it is treated as
 * {@link Policy#UNKNOWN}.
